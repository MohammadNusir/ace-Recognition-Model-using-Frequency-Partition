# ace-Recognition-Model-using-Frequency-Partition
The following model is developed in order to recognize face images based on Frequency Partition, multilayer singular value decomposition, covariance intersection, Laplacian Pyramid and multilayer discrete cosine transform feature fusion using the ORL dataset; The proposed model has four main stages. The first stage is face detection using viola jones face detection algorithm; the second stage is global and local feature extraction using principal component analysis and local binary pattern; the third stage is feature fusion  and the fourth and the final step is the classification using backpropagation neural network.
